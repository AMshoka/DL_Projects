# DL_Projects
The course starts off gradually with multi-layer preceptrons and it progresses into the more complicated
concepts such as attention and sequence-to-sequence models. This course also covers other models of deep learning such
as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep generative models such as autoregressive, GAN, VAE,
NFM, representation learning, and deep reinforcement learning methods. Method and materials are available.
